# Google's Women Techmakers - She Builds AI Hackathon

'She Builds AI hackathon' by Google's Women Techmakers, is a wonderful playground to craft apps that leverage the power of Generative AI. The idea is to develop an AI powered solution to address gender equity challenges around the world, as outlined in UN Sustainable Development Goal 5.  The 'AI Guardian Angel' is a Google Gemini Gen AI solution which majorly focus on the second target among the 'UN Goal 5 Targets'- i.e. 5.2 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.
